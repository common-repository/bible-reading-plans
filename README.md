This plugin provides the ability to embed Bible Reading Plans into a post or page using a shortcode.

## Description

This plugin provides the ability to embed Bible reading plans into a post or page using shortcode of the form <code>[bible-reading-plan reading_plan="mcheyne" source="DBP" version="NAS"]</code> or <code>[bible-reading-plan reading_plan="mcheyne" source="DBP" bible_id="ENGNAS"]</code>. **The latter form is new in this version, applies only to the DBP source, and *provides access to over 1700 Bible versions in more than 1500 languages,* with more versions and languages being added regularly.** Three sources for the Scriptures displayed for each plan are available: American Bible Society API, Version 1 (API.Bible), The Bible Brain (aka Digital Bible Platform) API, Version 4 (faithcomesbyhearing.com/bible-brain/developer-documentation), and the ESV Bible Web Service API, Version 3 (api.esv.org). See the screenshots for an example of how to use this plugin.

This plugin is a fork of the Embed Bible Passages plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-bible-passages/) made necessary by changes in the ESV Bible Web Service API. (Version 2 included Bible reading plans, but is deprecated and was terminate completely on 15 April 2021. Version 3 is the only version available to new users, but does not include Bible reading plans.) Since the American Bible Society API provides more than 20 English language versions (with the potential for more via the Digital Bible Library to acquire the necessary licenses) and over 1600 languages and the Bible Brain API provides 10 English versions and access to over 1700 Bible versions in more than 1500 languages. In addition it has the potential for audio and video for many of the versions. We hope this fork promises a much broader future than did the Embed Bible Passages plugin. The ESV Bible Web Service API, Version 3, however, has also been included in this plugin because it provides audio directly with the texts as well as better formatting control, even though it naturally provides only the English Standard Version.

If the "Display Plan Name on Pages" on the settings page is unchecked, the page displayed to the public will all be in the language of the bible_id used in the shortcode, with the exception of the copyright information and potentially the calendar.

It is hoped that persons with skills in other languages will come forward to localize this plugin for the available languages. (I.e., Translate things like the instructions on the "Settings" page, the reading plan names, and copyright statements.)

The values of reading_plan can be:

   ```back-to-the-bible-chronological``` - Back to the Bible Chronological
	```bcp19-acna-evening``` - Book of Common Prayer, 2019, Anglican Church in North America -- Evening Prayer
